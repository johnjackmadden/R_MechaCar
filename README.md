# Statistics in R
## Linear Regression to predict potential MPG
### 1) The variables and coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the miles per gallon output value were vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and all wheel drive. The other variables (ground clearence and vehcile length provided random variance
### 2) Since the P-value listed bellow in image one is less than zero, the slope is not equal to 0
### 3) The R squared value calculated in image one is equal to 71.49% so theres about a 71-72% chance that the predictions will be accurate based on this linear model
